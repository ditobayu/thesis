        Well, we cannot say all the following are disadvantages. Rather, we can say these are real world challenges we face when we implement a microservices architecture within our enterprise.

          The change requires within the team hierarchy when adopting to MSA can cause problems for some people. Hence we need to make sure they understand the philosophy and the advantages properly. Otherwise, this can cause problems in your organization if experienced team members leave the team.

          Nothing is green field these days. You definitely have to connect with existing systems and there is a more probability that these systems are built on top of monolithic architecture. These monoliths may require a limited resources (few servers) and your MSA may require more resources to provide lesser functionality due its complexity. You need to convince your C-level people that this investment is going to pay off.
        </li>
        <li>
          With the system becoming more and functional, deployment architectures can be pretty complex with various interconnections between services. This can cause problems when debugging and maintaining the system. You need to make that there are proper monitoring in place and orchestration layers are well designed.
        </li>
      </ul>
