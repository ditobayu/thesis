          Well, we cannot say all the following are disadvantages. Rather, we
          can say these are real world challenges we face when we implement a
          microservices architecture within our enterprise.

            The change requires within the team hierarchy when adopting to MSA
            can cause problems for some people. Hence we need to make sure they
            understand the philosophy and the advantages properly. Otherwise,
            this can cause problems in your organization if experienced team

            systems are built on top of monolithic architecture. These
            monoliths may require a limited resources (few servers) and your MSA
            may require more resources to provide lesser functionality due its
            complexity. You need to convince your C-level people that this
            investment is going to pay off.

            With the system becoming more and functional, deployment
            architectures can be pretty complex with various interconnections
            between services. This can cause problems when debugging and
            maintaining the system. You need to make that there are proper
